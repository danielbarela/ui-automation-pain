# This is why people don't test
This repository will serve as a collection of xcode projects that demonstrate the pain in the ass that ui automation is.  Why does it have to be so hard to test something beyond super simple stuff.  Go take a look all over the internet and it is the same tests, click a button, navigate a tab bar, click something in a table.  That is not how the real world works.

General Reasons:  
Can't simulate airplane mode.  Really?  C'mon.
